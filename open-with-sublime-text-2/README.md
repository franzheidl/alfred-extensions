Open files or a folders in [Sublime](http://www.sublimetext.com/) by using a Keyword ("owc") or by file/folder action.

When using the keyword, the currently selected items in Finder will be openend, if you currently have no selection, the frontmost folder will open in Sublime. If you have neither a selection nor an open Finder window to be opened, your user home directory will be openend as a default.
